**Pomo will notify you when it's time for a break, or time to focus.**

### Installation

Attention: Always inspect scripts before running

Clone the repo to your local machine. Then simply run the following command from the repo:
```bash 
./install.sh
```

**If you have this error `bash: pomo: command not found`**
  * Add `~/.local/bin` to your path
  * `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin' >> .bashrc`

### Examples
* Start a pomodoro with 20 minutes of focus time
    ```bash
    pomo 20
    ```
* 20 minutes of focus time and 3 minutes of break time
    ```bash
    pomo 20 3
    ```
* 20 minutes of focus time, 3 minutes of break time and 10 minutes of long break
    ```bash
    pomo 20 3 10
    ```
* 20 minutes of focus time, 3 minutes of break time, 10 minutes of long break and 4 cicles of focus until long break
    ```bash

    ```
